## MY PROJECTS 

*A glimpse of some of the projects I've been working on.*

**Providing Insight to the Revenue Team in the Hospitality Domain.**

Visage global owns multiple five-star hotels across Nigeria. Due to strategic move from other competitors and ineffective decision making in management, Visage global were losing their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. So, the revenue management team hired me to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Facility Management Data.**

An organization with facilities in several states in Nigeria needed insights on perfomance level and running cost of maintenance on all their facilities.So I analyzed their data and provided the value they seek.
